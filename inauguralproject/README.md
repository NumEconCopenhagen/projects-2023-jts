# Inaugural Project

Welcome to my Inaugural Project. 

The project investigates the production in the
labor market and the household for men and women who live together as couples.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

This project seeks to estimate the influence of women's wage relative to men's on their time spent working on the labour market.
